# Free2Shard DSA_sim
DSA simulation testbed

Run DSA_main.py to simulate DSA plots with a local adversarial fraction estimator.
The adversary described in section 4 refers to the function "generate_adv_strategy_latency".
The system implementation can be found at [Free2Shard](https://github.com/DDZ8GkLyKT/wvkA5Rc3jv)
